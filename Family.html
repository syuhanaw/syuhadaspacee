He made me understand that whenever we do <br>a task that we absolutely loves, it feels like the<br> energy was never drained from us. I was so fond of him; he was my best <br>friend, my enemy as well as<br> my caretaker. Oh, how I miss having him near. He <br>was a good father, but back then we don't know it yet. Now that we knew, <br> we no longer have the chance to tell him.</font></p><br></td>
